Here's an example:\n\n```lua\n-- Set the color scheme\nvim.cmd('colorscheme gruvbox')\n```\n\nIn the example above, we set the color scheme to be `gruvbox`. Replace `'gruvbox'` with the desired color scheme you want to use.\n\nMake sure to place this code in your `init.lua` file or any Lua file that is sourced by your Neovim configuration.\n\nRemember to install the color scheme you want to use before setting it in your configuration. You can do this by following the installation instructions provided by the color scheme's author."

Additionally, the caret symbol `^` is not a valid key code for Neovim.\n\nTo fix this, you can use the following corrected key mapping:\n\n```lua\n-- bind to the next buffer\nvim.keymap.set(\"n\", \"<C-s>\", \":bnext<CR>\")\n```\n\nIn the corrected mapping, `<C-s>` represents the Ctrl key followed by the lowercase letter \"s\", which is a valid key notation. It will trigger the `:bnext` command to go to the next buffer when pressed in normal mode. The `:bnext` command is then followed by `<CR>`, which simulates pressing the Enter key to execute the command.\n\nKeep in mind to add this code to your `init.lua` file or any Lua file that is sourced by your Neovim configuration."

Whenever you press this key combination in normal mode, it will execute the `:bnext` command, which moves to the next buffer. The `:bnext` command is then followed by `<CR>`, which simulates pressing the Enter key to execute the command.\n\nRemember to include this code in your `init.lua` file or any other Lua file sourced by your Neovim configuration."

            "content": "Sure! Below is an overview of the usage and complementarity of the CLI tools `ncdu`, `dust`, and `duf`:\n\n1. `ncdu` (NCurses Disk Usage):\n   - Usage: `ncdu` is a command-line utility that helps you analyze and visualize disk usage in a terminal-based interface.\n   - Complementarity: `ncdu` provides a detailed overview of disk usage, allows you to navigate through directories, sort data by size, and delete files directly from the interface. It is especially useful for identifying large files or directories taking up space on your system.\n\n2. `dust`:\n   - Usage: `dust` is a more intuitive replacement for the `du` command. It displays information about disk usage in a clean and colorful format.\n   - Complementarity: `dust` adds a visual aspect to viewing disk usage, making it easier to understand and navigate. Unlike `ncdu`, it doesn't provide a complete directory tree navigation interface but focuses on giving a quick and visually appealing overview of disk usage.\n\n3. `duf` (Disk Usage Free):\n   - Usage: `duf` is another alternative to the `du` command that presents disk usage information in a friendly and human-readable manner.\n   - Complementarity: Similar to `dust`, `duf` aims to present disk usage information in a more user-friendly way than the standard `du` command. It provides detailed information about storage devices, mount points, and even includes additional information such as temperature and file system type.\n\nWhile all three tools (`ncdu`, `dust`, and `duf`) focus on disk usage analysis, they each have their own unique features and presentation styles. Depending on your specific needs and preferences, you may find one tool more suitable than the others. It's worth trying them out to see which one works best for you."

            "content": "To close a buffer in Neovim without exiting the entire Neovim session, you can use the `:bd` command. Here's how to use it:\n\n1. Switch to the buffer you want to close by either clicking on it or using the `:buffer` command followed by the buffer number or name.\n2. Once you're in the desired buffer, use the `:bd` command to close it. The buffer will be removed, and you'll switch to a different buffer.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```\n:bd\n```\n\nIf you have unsaved changes in the buffer, Neovim will prompt you to save or discard the changes before closing the buffer. You can respond with either `:w` to save the changes, or `:q!` to discard them and forcibly close the buffer.\n\nRemember, closing a buffer with `:bd` only removes it from the current Neovim session. The buffer file itself remains unaffected on disk, and you can reopen it later if needed."
