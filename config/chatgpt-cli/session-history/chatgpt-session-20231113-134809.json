The last key, 'invalid_key', is excluded because it doesn't match the pattern."

Here's how you can achieve this on different platforms:\n\nOn Linux (using `xclip`):\n1. Install `xclip` if you don't have it installed already. You can install it by running the following command:\n   ```\n   sudo apt-get install xclip\n   ```\n2. Use the following command to copy the file to your clipboard:\n   ```\n   xclip -selection clipboard -t application/zip -i data.zip\n   ```\n\nOn macOS (using `pbcopy`):\n1. Use the following command to copy the file to your clipboard:\n   ```\n   cat data.zip | pbcopy\n   ```\n\nOn Windows (using `clip`):\n1. Use the following command to copy the file to your clipboard:\n   ```\n   clip < data.zip\n   ```\n\nAfter running the appropriate command for your platform, the \"data.zip\" file will be copied to your clipboard and can be pasted using the standard paste operation (`Ctrl+V` or `Cmd+V`)."

Here's the command you can use:\n\n```\ncat data.zip | pbcopy\n```\n\nThis command will read the content of the file \"data.zip\" and copy it to your clipboard. You can then paste the contents using the standard paste operation (`Cmd+V`).\n\nMake sure you are in the directory where the \"data.zip\" file is located or provide the complete path to the file in the command."
