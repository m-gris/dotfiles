The `nrows` parameter allows you to load a specific number of rows from the beginning of the file, but it does not provide an option to load a random sample.\n\nHowever, you can achieve this by using other `pandas` functions or techniques. One approach is to load the full dataset using `read_excel()` and then use the `sample()` function to select a random sample of rows. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the full dataset from the Excel file\ndf = pd.read_excel('path/to/file.xlsx')\n\n# Select a random sample of 100 rows\nsample_df = df.sample(n=100)\n```\n\nIn this example, `sample(n=100)` selects a random sample of 100 rows from the original dataframe `df`. You can adjust the `n` parameter to define the number of rows for your sample.\n\nKeep in mind that this approach will load the full dataset into memory before selecting the random sample. If memory usage or the size of the dataset is a concern, you may need to consider alternative methods or libraries specifically designed for working with big data or sampling large datasets."
