This indicates that there are extended attributes associated with those files.\n\nExtended attributes can provide additional metadata and properties to files, but they are not commonly seen in regular files. The presence of extended attributes might be a result of certain applications or processes that have added these attributes to the files.\n\nThese extended attributes could potentially interfere with the search functionality of the `fd` command, causing it to not find files that have extended attributes associated with them.\n\nTo further investigate and confirm if extended attributes are causing the issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Run the `ls -l@ data/01_raw` command to get a detailed view of the extended attributes associated with the files in the `data/01_raw` directory.\n\n2. Check if there are any specific extended attributes added to the file `EVENTS_REPORT_xdo_2023-11-06T11_50_34.116Z.csv`.

Double-check the current directory: Confirm that you are running the `fd` command in the correct directory where the `data/01_raw` directory is located.\n\n2. Verify the pattern: Make sure the pattern you are using is correct. Ensure that the case sensitivity of the pattern matches the file names in the directory.\n\n3. File permissions: Check if the file permissions on the files in the `data/01_raw` directory are set correctly. Ensure that you have the necessary read permissions to access the files.\n\n4.

Make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies for the Todo-comments plugin. Check if you have the required syntax highlighting plugin installed. The Todo-comments plugin relies on a syntax highlighting plugin, such as `vim-polyglot` or `nvim-treesitter`, to provide syntax highlighting for the TODO comments.\n\n2. Check the configuration of the Todo-comments plugin. Verify that the correct highlighting groups are assigned for the TODO, FIXME, and other comment keywords in your configuration file (`init.vim` or `.vimrc`). Ensure that the highlighting groups are defined properly and match your desired colors.\n\n   For example, in your configuration file, you might have something like:\n\n   ```vim\n   let g:todo_comments_highlight = 'Todo'\n   let g:fixme_comments_highlight = 'WarningMsg'\n   ```\n\n   Confirm that the assigned highlight groups (`Todo` and `WarningMsg` in this example) are defined in your color scheme or syntax file.\n\n3. Check for conflicting syntax highlighting plugins. Some syntax plugins might override or interfere with the highlighting of TODO comments. Try disabling or reordering other syntax highlighting plugins to see if it resolves the issue.\n\n4. Make sure your color scheme supports the highlighting groups used by the Todo-comments plugin. Some color schemes might not define all the necessary highlight groups, which can result in silent ignoring of syntax highlighting.\n\nRemember to restart NeoVim after making any changes to the configuration or plugin setup.\n\nIf the issue persists, consider consulting the Todo-comments plugin documentation or seeking assistance from the plugin's developer or community for further troubleshooting."

Choose a colorscheme that explicitly supports highlighting for TODO comments. Some popular colorschemes, such as Solarized, Monokai, or Nord, have built-in support for highlighting various programming elements, including TODO comments. You can search for colorschemes that specifically mention support for highlighting TODO comments.\n\n2. Adjust the colorscheme or create a custom highlight group. If you already have a preferred colorscheme and it doesn't include highlighting for TODO comments, you can modify the colorscheme directly or create a custom highlight group. To do this, you would typically add the highlight configuration to your vimrc or init.vim file.\n\n   For example, if you're using the default colorscheme, you can define a custom highlight group like this:\n\n   ```vim\n   \" Add this to your vimrc or init.vim\n   hi Todo ctermfg=white guifg=#ffffff\n   ```\n\n   This example sets the foreground color for the `Todo` highlight group to white. You can adjust the `ctermfg` and `guifg` values to match your preferred colors.\n\n3. Try different plugins or extensions. If the current colorscheme conflict persists and you are unable to resolve it, you could consider trying alternative plugins or extensions that focus specifically on highlighting TODO comments. For example, the vim-todo-syntax plugin is designed to provide comprehensive syntax highlighting for various TODO comment formats.\n\nRemember to restart NeoVim after making any changes to the colorscheme or highlight configurations.\n\nIf none of these suggestions resolve the issue, it may be helpful to seek assistance from the Todo-comments plugin developer or community for more specific guidance related to the colorscheme conflict."
