This can happen if the artifact is not published or if there is an issue with your network connection.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check your network connection to ensure you have internet access.\n2. Make sure you have specified the correct version of Clojure in your project.clj or deps.edn file.\n3. If you are using a build tool like Leiningen or Boot, try running the command with the `--offline` flag to force it to use the local repository cache.\n4. If you are behind a proxy, make sure you have configured the proxy settings correctly.\n\nIf the issue persists, you can try manually adding the Clojure artifact to your local repository. Here's an example using Leiningen:\n\n```bash\nlein install org.clojure/clojure \"1.11.1\"\n```\n\nAfterwards, retry running the command you initially encountered the error with.\n\nPlease note that the steps provided assume the usage of the Leiningen build tool. If you are using a different build tool, the commands may vary slightly, but the general idea remains the same."
