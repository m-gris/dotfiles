Install neovim (if not already installed):\n   - On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems:\n     ```\n     sudo apt-get install neovim\n     ```\n   - On Arch Linux:\n     ```\n     sudo pacman -S neovim\n     ```\n   - On macOS (using Homebrew):\n     ```\n     brew install neovim\n     ```\n   - For other operating systems, refer to the neovim installation instructions for your specific platform.\n\n2. Install the `flash.nvim` plugin. If you are using Vim-Plug as your plugin manager, add the following line to your `init.vim` or `.vimrc` file:\n   ```\n   Plug 'nvim-lua/flash.nvim'\n   ```\n   Then, reload your configuration file and run `:PlugInstall` to install the plugin.\n\n3. Configure `flash.nvim`:\n   You can modify the plugin settings as per your preferences in your `init.vim` or `.vimrc` file. Here is an example configuration:\n   ```\n   \" Set the key mapping for triggering `flash()`\n   nmap <leader>f <cmd>lua require('flash').flash()<CR>\n\n   \" Specify the duration for the flash (in milliseconds)\n   let g:flash#duration = 200\n\n   \" Set the flash colors. You can use hex codes or named colors.\n   let g:flash#highlight = {\n     \\ 'fg': '#ffffff',\n     \\ 'bg': '#ff0000',\n     \\ 'gui': 'bold',\n     \\ }\n   ```\n\n4. Save the configuration and restart neovim. You can now use the `<leader>f` key mapping to trigger the flash effect in your neovim editor.\n\nPlease note that `flash.nvim` requires Neovim 0.5 or later versions to work properly."

Here, we'll use Plug as an example.\n   - Add the following line to your `init.lua` or `init.vim` file to register `lazy.nvim` as a plugin:\n     ```lua\n     use 'kristijanhusak/lazy.nvim'\n     ```\n   - Save the configuration and restart Neovim.\n\n3. Configure `lazy.nvim` by adding the following lines to your `init.lua` or `init.vim` file:\n   ```lua\n   require(\"lazy\")\n   -- Set the key mappings\n   vim.cmd([[ \n     nnoremap <silent> <leader>l <cmd>lua require(\"lazygit\").lazygit()<CR>\n     vnoremap <silent> <leader>l <Esc><cmd>lua require(\"lazygit\").lazygit()<CR>\n     tnoremap <silent> <leader>l <C-\\><C-n><cmd>lua require(\"lazygit\").lazygit()<CR>\n   ]])\n   ```\n   Here, we have set the key mapping `<leader>l` to trigger `lazygit`, but you can choose any other key mapping according to your preference.\n\n4. Save the configuration and restart Neovim. You can now use `<leader>l` key mapping to trigger the `lazygit` command.\n\nPlease note that `lazy.nvim` provides lazy-loading of plugins, allowing faster Neovim startup times. You can add more plugins to `lazy.nvim` using the same pattern as described above."

You can add key-value pairs to the table by using either the square bracket syntax (`opts[\"key\"]`) or the dot notation (`opts.key`). Later, you can pass this table as an argument to another function or module.\n\nPlease note that the specific usage and behavior of the `opts` table may depend on the context in which it is used."

It helps in maintaining a consistent code style across different projects.\n\nWhen the `-- stylua: ignore` comment is placed at the beginning of a block of code, it tells stylua not to apply any formatting changes to that specific block. This is helpful when you want to preserve the formatting of certain sections of code that might not conform to the stylistic preferences enforced by stylua.\n\nHere's an example of how the `-- stylua: ignore` comment can be used:\n\n```lua\n-- stylua: ignore\nlocal myTable = {\n  -- A table with custom formatting\n  key1 = \"value1\",\n  key2 = \"value2\",\n}\n\n-- Rest of the code\n```\n\nIn the above code, the `myTable` assignment block will not be reformatted by stylua, preserving the custom formatting. The rest of the code will be formatted according to the stylua rules.\n\nNote that the specific behavior of stylua and the supported configuration options may vary, so it's advisable to refer to the stylua documentation or project page for more details on how to configure and use it."
