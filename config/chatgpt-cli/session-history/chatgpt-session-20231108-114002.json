            "content": "To make it more visually obvious which tmux pane has the focus, you can customize the appearance of the active pane by changing the colors or adding borders.\n\nHere are a few options you can try:\n\n1. Change the background color: Add the following line to your `~/.tmux.conf` file to change the background color of the active pane:\n\n   ```shell\n   set -g window-style 'bg=colour234'\n   ```\n\n   You can replace `colour234` with any color code that you prefer. Here is a list of available color codes: [TermColors (tmux.github.io)](https://tmux.github.io/issue-2552/termcolors.html)\n\n2. Add borders: You can add borders around the active pane to make it stand out. Add the following line to your `~/.tmux.conf` file:\n\n   ```shell\n   set -g pane-active-border-style 'fg=colour202'\n   ```\n\n   This will add a border around the active pane with the color `colour202`. You can change the color code to your preference.\n\n3. Customize the status line: Another option is to modify the status line to highlight the active pane. Here's an example of how to set up a custom status line for the active pane:\n\n   ```shell\n   # Add this to your ~/.tmux.conf file\n   set -g status-left-length 32\n   set -g status-left '#[fg=yellow]Active Pane:'\n   set -g window-status-current-format '#[fg=white,bold]#I:#W#F'\n   ```\n\n   This will display \"Active Pane:\" in yellow on the left side of the status line and highlight the active pane with a bold white font color.\n\nAfter making these changes, don't forget to reload your tmux configuration by running `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf` or restarting your tmux session."

The color codes in tmux are often specified using the format `fg=colourXXX` for the foreground color and `bg=colourXXX` for the background color, where `XXX` represents the color code. \n\nColor codes in tmux range from `colour0` to `colour255`. The colors may differ depending on your terminal emulator and configuration. The tmux wiki provides a handy page where you can view the available color codes and their corresponding color representations: [TermColors (tmux.github.io)](https://tmux.github.io/issue-2552/termcolors.html)\n\nRegarding transparency, unfortunately, tmux does not support changing the transparency of panes natively. Transparency settings are usually handled by the terminal emulator itself. If your terminal emulator supports transparency, you can configure it separately from tmux.\n\nNote that not all terminal emulators support transparency, and the method for configuring transparency varies depending on the emulator you are using. You would need to refer to the documentation or settings of your specific terminal emulator to enable transparency if supported.\n\nFor example, if you are using popular terminal emulators like iTerm2 on macOS or Alacritty, they offer settings to control the transparency of the terminal window. These settings are separate from the configuration of tmux.\n\nIf you want to explore transparency options further, please let me know which terminal emulator you are using, and I can provide guidance on how to configure transparency if it is supported by your emulator."

I apologize for the confusion caused.\n\nIn tmux, there is no direct option to set both `bold` and `underline` as attributes for the status line of the active pane. You can only set one attribute at a time.\n\nHowever, you can achieve a similar effect by modifying the format string of the status line. Here's an example of how you can modify the status line to have both `bold` and `underline` characteristics for the active pane:\n\n```shell\n# Add this to your ~/.tmux.conf file\nset -g status-left-length 32\nset -g status-left '#[fg=yellow]Active Pane:'\nset -g window-status-current-format '#[fg=white,bold,underline]#I:#W#F'\n```\n\nIn the above example, we modify the `window-status-current-format` option to include both `bold` and `underline` attributes for the active pane. The format string `#[fg=white,bold,underline]` applies these attributes to the pane identifier (#I), window name (#W), and flags (#F) components of the status line.\n\nAfter making these changes, reload your tmux configuration or restart tmux for the changes to take effect. The active pane in the status line should now appear with both `bold` and `underline` characteristics.\n\nI apologize for the confusion caused by my previous response.

For example, to use `\u270e` instead of `[+]`, you can set it as follows:\n\n```vim\nset statusline+=%{&modified? '\u270e' : ''}\n```\n\nFeel free to experiment with different symbols or text to find a representation that suits your preferences."

This makes it more visually distinct. Here's an example configuration:\n\n   ```vim\n   hi ModifiedLine cterm=bold ctermfg=black ctermbg=red\n   au InsertEnter * match ModifiedLine /./\n   au InsertLeave * call clearmatches()\n   ```\n\n   In this example, the modified lines will have a bold font and a red background color. The highlighting is activated when entering insert mode and is cleared when leaving insert mode.\n\n2. **Set a different color scheme**: You can choose a color scheme specifically designed to highlight modified lines. There are various color schemes available for Neovim that offer distinct visual cues for modified lines. Some popular color schemes with noticeable modified line highlighting are:\n\n   - [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)\n   - [nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-vim)\n   - [onedark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim)\n\n   You can install these color schemes using a plugin manager like vim-plug and activate them by adding the appropriate configuration to your `init.vim` file.\n\nKeep in mind that customizing the appearance of modified lines may depend on the color scheme you are using and the options available in that particular color scheme. You can search for color schemes and try out different configurations until you find one that provides the visual cue you desire.\n\nRemember to reload Neovim or reopen your files after making any configuration changes to see the updated visual cues for modified lines.\n"

If you use Lua for your Neovim configuration and wish to have a more obvious visual cue for modified lines, you can modify the background color or add custom highlights using Lua.

The modified lines will have a red background color and will be highlighted when entering insert mode.\n\nAdditionally, we customize the sign column to display a custom sign (`\u25cf`) for modified lines using the `ModifiedLine` sign group. This sign column indication further helps in visually identifying modified lines.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes you have support for `termguicolors` enabled in your Neovim configuration (`set termguicolors`). If you don't use `termguicolors`, you can use the `ctermfg` option instead of `guibg` and `ctermbg`.\n\nFeel free to modify the colors, symbols, or any other aspect of this example to better suit your preferences.
