You can use this option to specify a comma-separated list of column numbers where you want the vertical bar to appear.\n\nTo enable the vertical bar at column 80, you can add the following line to your Vim configuration file (`init.lua`):\n\n```lua\nvim.opt.colorcolumn = \"80\"\n```\n\nMake sure to add this line outside the `augroup ModifiedLines` block. This will set the `'colorcolumn'` option to display a vertical bar at column 80.\n\nAfter adding this line, you can try the modified code block I provided earlier to change the color of the vertical bar when a file is modified but not saved.\n\nLet me know if this helps, or if you have any further questions!"

Unfortunately, Vim does not have a built-in feature to dynamically change the color of the `'colorcolumn'` option based on the state of the buffer (modified or not saved).\n\nThe color of the vertical bar set by `'colorcolumn'` is determined by the color scheme you're using. You can change the color scheme or modify the existing color scheme to customize the appearance of the vertical bar.\n\nIf you'd like to explore customizing the color scheme or using a plugin to achieve this functionality, I'd recommend checking Vim's plugin repository (https://www.vim.org/scripts/) for potential solutions.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!"

The statusline is the line at the bottom of the Vim window that displays various information about the current buffer.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the statusline color:\n\n```lua\n-- Add this to your init.lua\n\n-- Change the statusline colors for modified buffers\nvim.cmd([[\naugroup ModifiedStatusline\n  autocmd!\n  autocmd BufWritePre * hi ModifiedStatusline guifg=#ff0000\n  autocmd BufWritePost * hi ModifiedStatusline guifg=NONE\naugroup END\n]])\n```\n\nIn this example, the foreground color (`guifg`) of the statusline is changed to red (`#ff0000`) when a buffer is modified but not saved. Once the buffer is saved, the foreground color is set to the default value (`NONE`).\n\nYou can modify this code further to customize the appearance of the statusline based on your preferences.\n\nLet me know if this helps, or if you have any further questions!"
