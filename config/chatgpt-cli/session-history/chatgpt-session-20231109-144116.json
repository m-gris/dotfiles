Install `lazy` by running the following command:\n```bash\nnpm install -g lazy\n```\n\n2. Once `lazy` is installed, create a `package.json` file in your project directory by running the following command:\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\n\n3. Open the `package.json` file and add `flash.nvim` as a dependency in the `\"dependencies\"` section:\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"flash.nvim\": \"latest\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Install the dependencies specified in `package.json` by running the following command:\n```bash\nlazy install\n```\n\n5. Import and use `flash.nvim` in your code as needed:\n```javascript\nconst flash = require('flash.nvim');\n\n// Example usage\nflash('Hello, World!');\n```\n\nThat's it! You have successfully installed `flash.nvim` using `lazy`."

            "content": "Apologies for the confusion. There is no package manager called `lazy.nvim`, but if you're referring to the `plug` plugin manager and `nvim` (Neovim), you can follow these instructions:\n\n1. Install `nvim` by following the official installation instructions for your operating system. You can find the installation guide [here](https://neovim.io/).\n\n2. Once `nvim` is installed, you need to install the `plug` plugin manager. Open a terminal and run the following command:\n```bash\ncurl -fLo ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \\\n    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim\n```\n\n3. Create the necessary configuration file for Neovim by running the following command:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/nvim\ntouch ~/.config/nvim/init.vim\n```\n\n4. Open the `init.vim` file in a text editor and add the following lines to configure `plug` and install plugins:\n```vim\ncall plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')\nPlug 'https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim' \" Example plugin\n\" Add more plugins here\ncall plug#end()\n```\nReplace `'https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim'` with the GitHub repository URL of `flash.nvim` or any other plugin you want to install.\n\n5. Save and close the `init.vim` file. Then, open `nvim` in your terminal by running the following command:\n```bash\nnvim\n```\n\n6. Inside `nvim`, run the following command to install the plugins specified in the `init.vim` file:\n```\n:PlugInstall\n```\n\nWait for the plugins to be installed. Once the installation is complete, you can start using `flash.nvim`, or any other plugins you installed, in your `nvim` editor.\n\nNote: If you are using Vim instead of Neovim, the process is similar, but the config file is located at `~/.vimrc` instead of `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`."
