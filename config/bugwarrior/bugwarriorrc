# Three backends are currently supported:

#  - growlnotify (v2)   Mac OS X   "gntp" must be installed
#  - gobject            Linux      python gobject must be installed

# To configure, adjust the settings below.  Note that neither of the #
# "sticky" options have any effect on Linux.  They only work for
# growlnotify.
